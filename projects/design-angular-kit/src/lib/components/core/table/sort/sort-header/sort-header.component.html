<!--
  We set the `tabindex` on an element inside the table header, rather than the header itself,
  because of a bug in NVDA where having a `tabindex` on a `th` breaks keyboard navigation in the
  table (see https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/7718). This allows for the header to both
  be focusable, and have screen readers read out its `aria-sort` state. We prefer this approach
  over having a button with an `aria-label` inside the header, because the button's `aria-label`
  will be read out as the user is navigating the table's cell (see #13012).

  The approach is based off of: https://dequeuniversity.com/library/aria/tables/sf-sortable-grid

<div
  class="it-sort-header-container it-focus-indicator"
  [class.it-sort-header-sorted]="isSorted"
  [class.it-sort-header-position-before]="arrowPosition === 'before'"
  [attr.tabindex]="isDisabled ? null : 0"
  [attr.role]="isDisabled ? null : 'button'">
  <!--
    We have to keep it due to a large number of screenshot diff failures. It should be removed eventually.
    Note that the difference isn't visible with a shorter header, but once it breaks up into multiple lines, this element
    causes it to be center-aligned, whereas removing it will keep the text to the left.
