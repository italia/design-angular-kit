<!--
  We set the `tabindex` on an element inside the table header, rather than the header itself,
  because of a bug in NVDA where having a `tabindex` on a `th` breaks keyboard navigation in the
  table (see https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/7718). This allows for the header to both
  be focusable, and have screen readers read out its `aria-sort` state. We prefer this approach
  over having a button with an `aria-label` inside the header, because the button's `aria-label`
  will be read out as the user is navigating the table's cell (see #13012).

  The approach is based off of: https://dequeuniversity.com/library/aria/tables/sf-sortable-grid

     [attr.tabindex]="_isDisabled() ? null : 0"
     [attr.role]="_isDisabled() ? null : 'button'">

    TODO(crisbeto): this div isn't strictly necessary, but we have to keep it due to a large
    number of screenshot diff failures. It should be removed eventually. Note that the difference
    isn't visible with a shorter header, but once it breaks up into multiple lines, this element
    causes it to be center-aligned, whereas removing it will keep the text to the left.
